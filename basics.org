* Vision / Mission
We want a modern, elegantly simple content management
system/platform - built using Clojure and FP principles.  

Clotent should be easy and simple for its audiences to use,
e.g. straightforward for a developer to integrate into an existing
system, or for a user to create a new page/article at a URI of her
choice.  There should be "escalating delight" as users discover
Clotent's features.

Clotent's high-level goals:
1. *Unified content* data model: "It's all content."
   - From the user-perspective/UX, there's *one party* (person,
     organization, or brand) behind an app or website, with *many
     digital touchpoints*
   - e.g. in the user's mind, a domain's homepage and emails from it
     are all just the creator-party's content.
   - So Clotent's data model should support a unified view of those
     touchpoints - conceptually matching the UX.  e.g. if a user
     visits a webpage, signs up for email freebie, reads the email,
     clicks on site link, reads the new page, leaves a comment -
     *these are all actions/events on Clotent entities*.
   - We want to avoid the usual content silos of webpage-copy, email,
     images, wiki, comments, forums, etc. Those content silos arose
     from the incidental complexity of SQL/relational table models,
     which had to be different for each type.
   - What are the entities in Clotent? *Anything with a
     URI*. Content-atoms: irreducible units of text and binary
     data. Content-molecules: structured combinations of
     content-atoms.
   - So all of Clotent's content-atoms/entities should share: base
     content metadata (e.g. unique id, URI), and polymorphic
     operators.
2. *Pervasive content relations* matter: "It's all connected."
   - Relationships between content are often as important as the
     content itself, e.g. think of great comments/discussion on a good
     article.
   - In Clotent, every content-atom is related/connected to another,
     in some way.
   - Relations can be explicit, e.g. hyperlink, or content-atom Y is a
     comment on content-atom X, or image Z is a thumbnail version of
     the original image A.
   - Or relations can be implicit, e.g. content-atom Y is preceded by
     X, and followed by Y.  Or content-atom A is the title/parent of
     X, Y and Z.
   - Relations can be added automatically over time, e.g. by analyzing
     user interaction trails/events, or ML recommendation engines, or
     from content-analysis/similarity-scores, etc.
3. *Evolving composition*: "New evolves from the old."
   - The entire history of content in a Clotent system is tracked and
     available, from immutable data models.
   - Git-like versioning of "content atoms" supports the reality of
     re-writing and revision, as well as newer statistical content
     revisions/evolution like A/B testing.
4. *Device/delivery-agnostic*: "Write once, publish anywhere."
   - The same content should be easily reformatted/re-purposed for
     desktop, mobile, email, apps, etc.
   - Technically, a strong separation-of-concerns (content
     vs. presentation) will enable this.
5. *Non-monolithic* architecture: "CMS-as-API, CMS-as-library."
   - Your code should call the CMS, not the other way around.  Avoid
     the usual approach of CMS as monolithic architecture/framework,
     that you must adapt to and work-around.
